        <h2 id="dog_work">Tips for working from home with a pet</h2><br><br>
        <p> 1. Pet bed in office. Consider placing a cozy pet bed in your office, <br>
            or on your desk if your pet is small, so your pet is nearby throughout the day. <br>
            This will help you remain more focused as you won’t be concerned about <br>
            what your pet might be doing when out of sight.<br>
            2. Watch treats. Now that you’re spending more quality time with your pet, <br>
            be sure to gauge how many treats you’re giving them each day. <br>
            Being with your pet for a greater amount of time could lead to <br>
            offering more treats and causing them to overeat.<br>
            3. Schedule breaks for walks. One of the best benefits of working <br>
            from home is being able to structure your day so it meshes with your lifestyle. <br>
            Be sure to schedule walk breaks during the day so you and your pet <br>
            can get out for a breath of fresh air frequently.</p>
